Examples of async code to accompany lecture. To run a script, do `node request/github.js`, for example

## NPM modules used:
  - [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) - makes async http calls, uses callback pattern
  - [`axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - makes async http calls, uses promises
  - [`fs-extra`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) - like node's `fs` module, but with promises
